# Quadratic Snowflake

This Quadratic Snowflake is an [L-System Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system). As such it's not very remarkable or famous mathematically, but I think it still looks quite pretty. Just like the [Board](/l-system/board) or the [Crystal](/l-system/crystal).

It is generated by the L-System Algorithm with the following settings: 

```ts
const quadraticSnowflake: Ruleset = {
    color: "#80b8f9",
    minIterations: 1,
    maxIterations: 7,
    axiom: "FF+FF+FF+FF",
    replace: {
      F: "F+F-F-F+F",
    },
    angle: 90,
    initLength: (sizes) => Math.min(sizes.width, sizes.height) / 2.5,
    initTranslation: (sizes, initialLength) => [
      sizes.width / 2 - initialLength,
      sizes.height / 2 + initialLength,
    ],
    divideFactor: 3,
};
```

This fractal, by its nature as an L-System, is related to all the other L-System Fractals. A few you can check out: [Crystal](/l-system/crystal), [Fern 3](/l-system/fern-3), and the [LÃ©vy Curve](/l-system/levy-curve).

The alphabet to instructions set used to draw this fractal are the same as for the other L-Systems:

```ts
const drawRules: Record<string, () => void> = {
    V: () => {},
    W: () => {},
    X: () => {},
    Y: () => {},
    Z: () => {},
    G: drawForward,
    F: drawForward,
    f: () => ctx.translate(0, -len),
    "+": () => ctx.rotate(angle * rotationDirection),
    "-": () => ctx.rotate(angle * -rotationDirection),
    "|": () => ctx.rotate(180),
    "[": () => ctx.push(),
    "]": () => ctx.pop(),
    "#": () => (ctx.lineWidth = weight += weightIncrement) ,
    "!": () => (ctx.lineWidth = weight -= weightIncrement) ,
    ">": () => (len *= scale),
    "<": () => (len /= scale),
    "&": () => (rotationDirection = -rotationDirection),
    "(": () => (angle += angleIncrement),
    ")": () => (angle -= angleIncrement),
};
```

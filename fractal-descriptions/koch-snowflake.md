# Koch Snowflake

The Koch Snowflake is a famous fractal. It is also known as Koch Island and is closely related to the different versions of the [Koch Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake). It's usually generated by recursively subdividing line segments by adding small triangles to them. Different variations with different angles for the created triangles exist.

What you see here is an [L-System Implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), which is generated by the L-System Algorithm with the following settings: 

```ts
const kochSnowflake: Ruleset = {
  color: "#b1e5e8",
  minIterations: 1,
  maxIterations: 7,
  axiom: "F++F++F",
  replace: {
    F: "F-F++F-F",
  },
  angle: 60,
  initLength: (sizes) => Math.min(sizes.width, sizes.height) * 0.8,
  initTranslation: (sizes, initialLength) => [
    sizes.width / 2 - initialLength / 3,
    sizes.height / 2 + initialLength / 2,
  ],
  divideFactor: 3,
};
```

This fractal, by its nature as an L-System, is related to all the other L-System Fractals. A few you can check out: [Hilbert Curve](/l-system/hilbert-curve), [Fern 1](/l-system/fern-1), and the [LÃ©vy Curve](/l-system/levy-curve).

The alphabet to instructions set used to draw this fractal are the same as for the other L-Systems:

```ts
const drawRules: Record<string, () => void> = {
    V: () => {},
    W: () => {},
    X: () => {},
    Y: () => {},
    Z: () => {},
    G: drawForward,
    F: drawForward,
    f: () => ctx.translate(0, -len),
    "+": () => ctx.rotate(angle * rotationDirection),
    "-": () => ctx.rotate(angle * -rotationDirection),
    "|": () => ctx.rotate(180),
    "[": () => ctx.push(),
    "]": () => ctx.pop(),
    "#": () => (ctx.lineWidth = weight += weightIncrement) ,
    "!": () => (ctx.lineWidth = weight -= weightIncrement) ,
    ">": () => (len *= scale),
    "<": () => (len /= scale),
    "&": () => (rotationDirection = -rotationDirection),
    "(": () => (angle += angleIncrement),
    ")": () => (angle -= angleIncrement),
};
```

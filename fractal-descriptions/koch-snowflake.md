# Koch Snowflake

The Koch Snowflake is a famous fractal. It is also known as Koch Island, and is closely related to the different versions of the [Koch Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake). It's usually generated by recursively subdividing line segments by adding small triangles to them. Different variations with different angles for the created triangles exist.

What you see here is an [L-System Implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), which is generated by the L-System Algorithm with the following settings: 

```ts
const crystal: Ruleset = {
    color: "#18fce0",
    minIterations: 1,
    maxIterations: 7,
    axiom: "F+F+F+F",
    replace: {
      F: "FF+F++F+F",
    },
    angle: 90,
    initLength: (p5) => Math.min(p5.width, p5.height) * 0.7,
    initTranslation: (p5, initialLength) => [
      p5.width / 2 - initialLength / 2,
      p5.height / 2 + initialLength / 2,
    ],
    divideFactor: 3,
};
```

This fractal, by its nature as an L-System, is related to all the other L-System Fractals. A few you can check out: [Hilbert Curve](/l-system/hilbert-curve), [Fern 1](/l-system/fern-1), and the [LÃ©vy Curve](/l-system/levy-curve).

The alphabet to instructions set used to draw this fractal are the same as for the other L-Systems:

```ts
const drawRules: Record<string, () => void> = {
    V: () => {},
    W: () => {},
    X: () => {},
    Y: () => {},
    Z: () => {},
    G: drawForward,
    F: drawForward,
    f: () => p5.translate(0, -len),
    "+": () => p5.rotate(angle * rotationDirection),
    "-": () => p5.rotate(angle * -rotationDirection),
    "|": () => p5.rotate(180),
    "[": () => p5.push(),
    "]": () => p5.pop(),
    "#": () => p5.strokeWeight((weight += weightIncrement)),
    "!": () => p5.strokeWeight((weight -= weightIncrement)),
    ">": () => (len *= scale),
    "<": () => (len /= scale),
    "&": () => (rotationDirection = -rotationDirection),
    "(": () => (angle += angleIncrement),
    ")": () => (angle -= angleIncrement),
};
```

# Sierpinski Arrowhead

The Arrowhead Curve is a curve that is tracing out the *exact* same shape as the [Sierpinski Triangle](/l-system/sierpinski-triangle). As such it has many of the awesome properties of the Sierpinski Triangle as well -> such as an area of 0. 

Which to me is mindbending. Here we have a space-filling curve, that yet, not like the [Hilbert Curve](/l-system/hilbert-curve) or the [Sierpinski Curve](/l-system/sierpinski-curve) has no area. Because it is "filling" the space taken up by a shape that does not take up space... 

This back-and-forth of ideas to me is mind-bending. If you were to paint a Sierpinski Arrowhead Curve that would mean that you would need no paint. The same is true for [the Sierpinski Carpet](/sierpinski-carpet) btw. as well.

To construct the Arrowhead Curve, you start with a line and then replace the line with 3 new lines connecting at $120°$ angles. Then repeat for each of the new lines created this way, and so on – recursively.

What you see here is an [L-System Implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), which is generated by the L-System Algorithm with the following settings: 

```ts
const sierpinskiArrowhead: Ruleset = {
    maxIterations: 11,
    minIterations: 1,
    color: "#FCD227",
    axiom: "YF",
    replace: {
        X: "YF+XF+Y",
        Y: "XF-YF-X",
    },
    angle: 60,
    initLength: (sizes) => Math.min(sizes.width, sizes.height),
    initTranslation: (sizes, initialLength) => {
        const totalHeight = (initialLength * Math.sqrt(3)) / 2;
        return [
        sizes.width / 2 - initialLength / 2,
        sizes.height - (sizes.height - totalHeight) / 2,
        ];
    },
    initRotation: (ctx, config) => {
        ctx.rotate(radians(30));
        if (config && config.iterations % 2 === 0) ctx.rotate(radians(60));
        if (config && config.iterations < 5) ctx.lineWidth = 2;
    },
    divideFactor: 2,
};
```

This fractal, by its nature as an L-System, is *also* related to all the other L-System Fractals. A few you can check out: [Sierpinski Curve](/l-system/sierpinski-curve), [Fern 1](/l-system/fern-1), and the [Lévy Curve](/l-system/levy-curve).

The alphabet to instructions set used to draw this fractal are the same as for the other L-Systems:

```ts
const drawRules: Record<string, () => void> = {
    V: () => {},
    W: () => {},
    X: () => {},
    Y: () => {},
    Z: () => {},
    G: drawForward,
    F: drawForward,
    f: () => ctx.translate(0, -len),
    "+": () => ctx.rotate(angle * rotationDirection),
    "-": () => ctx.rotate(angle * -rotationDirection),
    "|": () => ctx.rotate(180),
    "[": () => ctx.push(),
    "]": () => ctx.pop(),
    "#": () => (ctx.lineWidth = weight += weightIncrement) ,
    "!": () => (ctx.lineWidth = weight -= weightIncrement) ,
    ">": () => (len *= scale),
    "<": () => (len /= scale),
    "&": () => (rotationDirection = -rotationDirection),
    "(": () => (angle += angleIncrement),
    ")": () => (angle -= angleIncrement),
};
```

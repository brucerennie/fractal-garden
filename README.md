# fractal-garden

This is a project where I want to build a kind of "garden" for fractals. In the end, this project should:

1. be open-source 
2. allow people to add new fractals to the mix
3. be a resource for learning about L-systems and different algorithms, to generate fractals
4. look pretty 
5. show connections between different fractals
6. provide common tooling. Like coloring, utils like zoom/pan and so on, iterators etc. to make it easier to add more fractals to the garden.
